In multiple fields, including voice recognition, music genre classification, and ambient sound detection, audio classification is significant.
The ability to automatically classify and analyse audio signals has significant advantages for organising content, monitoring acoustics, and conducting surveillance. 
This project suggests a novel approach for classifying audio with an emphasis on environmental sound recognition.
The primary objective of this project is to create an effective and efficient system that can classify environmental sounds into predetermined groups.
To extract useful information from audio sources and enable accurate categorization, the system will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning models.
